This repository contains source codes for four single-objective mathematical models and one algorithm developed to solve a multi-objective model with a prioritized optimization approach as follows:
M1MinOfStation- Model to find minimum number of stations
M2MinTotalDistance- Model to find minimum total distance
M3MinUAD- Model to find minimum number of unairworthy days
M4MinTotalCost- Model to find minimum total cost
MultiObjAlg1- Algorithm to solve a multi-objective model with a prioritized optimization approach
